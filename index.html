    <h1>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</h1>
    <p>Chapter 1 The Fence 
    </p>
    <p>Tom Sawyer lived with his aunt because his mother and 
        father were dead. Tom didn’t like going to school, and he 
        didn’t like working. He liked playing and having 
        adventures. One Friday, he didn’t go to school—he went 
        to the river.</p>
    <p>Aunt Polly was angry. “You’re a bad boy!” she said. 
        “Tomorrow you can’t play with your friends because you 
        didn’t go to school today. Tomorrow you’re going to work 
        for me. You can paint the fence.”</p>
    <p>Saturday morning, Tom was not happy, but he started to 
        paint the fence. His friend Jim was in the street.</p>
    
    <p>Tom asked him, “Do you want to paint?” </p>
    <p>Jim said, “No, I can’t. I’m going to get water.”</p>
    <p>Then Ben came to Tom’s house. He watched Tom and 
        said, “I’m going to swim today. You can’t swim because 
        you’re working.”</p>
    <p>Tom said, “This isn’t work. I like painting.” 
        “Can I paint, too?” Ben asked.</p>
    <p>“No, you can’t,” Tom answered. “Aunt Polly asked me 
        because I’m a very good painter.” 
        Ben said, “I’m a good painter, too. Please, can I paint? I 
        have some fruit. Do you want it?”</p>
    <p>OK,” Tom said. “Give me the fruit. Then you can paint.” 
        Ben started to paint the fence. Later, many boys came to 
        Tom’s house. They watched Ben, and they wanted to 
        paint, too. 
        Tom said, “Give me some food and you can paint.” </p>

    <p>Tom stayed in the yard, and the boys painted. They 
        painted the fence three times. It was beautiful and white.</p>
    <p>Tom went into the house. “Aunt Polly, can I play now?” 
        he asked.</p>
    <p>Aunt Polly was surprised. “Did you paint the fence?” 
        she asked.</p>
    <p>“Yes, I did,” Tom answered. 
        Aunt Polly went to the yard and looked at the fence. She 
        was very surprised and very happy. “It’s beautiful!” she 
        said. “Yes, you can play now.”</p>

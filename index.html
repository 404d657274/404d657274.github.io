    <h1>The Last Photo</h1>
    <p>

        It is Saturday afternoon. Martin and his sister Pam are in Cambridge for the day.
        <br>
        They are looking at the beautiful old buildings of this University City.
        <br>
        Pam has a camera with her. She likes taking photos and sometimes they are very good. But sometimes they are not very good and Martin laughs at them.
        <br>
        It is five o'clock. Pam and Martin are going home now. They are tired after their long day. They are in the garden near the bus station. "Let's have a last photo of you," says Pam.
        <br>
        "Oh no, not again," says Martin.
        <br>
        "Come on," says Pam. "It's the last one, I want to finish the film in my camera."
        <br>
        "Oh, all right," says Martin,
        <br>
        He stands in front of the flowers.
        <br>
        "Look at me," says Pam and takes a photo.
        <br>
        A man with a big rucksack on his back walks between Pam and Martin.
        <br>
        "Oh no," says Pam. "Now I've got a picture of that man, not of you, Martin."
        <br>
        The man looks at Pam. He is angry. He goes across the road without a word.
        <br>
        "That man isn't very nice, is he?" says Martin.
        <br>
        "No," says Pam. "And that was the last picture on the film, too."
        <br>
        The man with the rucksack on his back goes into the bus station. He has got sunglasses and a blue hat.
        <br>
        "Come on," says Martin. "Let's find our bus."
        <br>
        They go into the bus station.
        <br>
        "Look," says Martin. "There's that man again. He's getting into that bus. He's going to Aberdeen. That's in Scotland."
        <br>
        "Good," says Pam. "Far from here and far from me!" She is angry with the man.
        <br>
        Three days later, on Tuesday, Pam has got her photos from the shop.
        <br>
        "Look at these," she says to Martin. "They're the photos of us in Cambridge."
        <br>
        "Oh, these are all very good," says Martin.
        <br>
        "But not this last one," says Pam. "Look, it's that man with the rucksack."
        <br>
        In the photo, the man is in front of Martin. You cannot see Martin behind the man's rucksack.
        <br>
        "Wait a minute," says Martin. "I know that face. It's in the newspaper. Have you got it?"
        <br>
        "Today's newspaper?" says Pam. "Yes, it's here. Why?"
        <br>
        "Yes, here he is. Look at this picture," says Martin.
        <br>
        Pam looks at the photo in the newspaper.
        <br>
        "Who's that?" she asks.
        <br>
        "It says in the paper his name's Alan Rook," says Martin. "And he works in a bank in London. But on Monday morning - yesterday morning - no Alan Rook! The people at the bank don't know where he is. And they say he's got a hundred thousand pounds with him. The police are looking for him, too."
        <br>
        "But is that the man in my photo?" asks Pam. "He hasn't got a beard and he hasn't any hair."
        <br>
        "Look at his ears. Look at his nose," says Martin. "It's him. I know it is."
        <br>
        Martin has an idea. He takes a pencil and starts to draw on the newspaper.
        <br>
        "What are you doing?" asks Pam.
        <br>
        "Look," says Martin. "I'm putting dark glasses and a two-day beard on the man in this photo. Now I'm drawing a hat on his head. See? Now look at the two pictures."
        <br>
        "You're right," says Pam. "It's him. It's Alan Rook."
        <br>
        "Come on," says Martin. "Let's take these pictures to the police."
        <br>
        At the police station Pam and Martin, speak to a policeman.
        <br>
        They put Pam's photo and the newspaper on the table and they tell their story.
        <br>
        "That's Alan Rook," says the policeman, "In Cambridge at 5 o'clock on Saturday. The big question is - where is he now?"
        <br>
        "We think we know. He's in Scotland, in Aberdeen," says Pam, "Or he's near there." They tell the policeman about the man and the bus to Aberdeen.
        <br>
        "He's got a rucksack and a tent on his back in the photo," says the policeman. "He Isn't living in a hotel. He's camping. If we're lucky, he's still in Scotland. I must make a telephone call."
        <br>
        The policeman telephones the police station in Aberdeen.
        <br>
        "Alan Rook's in Scotland," he says. "We think he's camping near Aberdeen. He's got a short beard now," The next day the police in Aberdeen find Alan Rook in a tent in the mountains near Aberdeen. The money from the bank is in his rucksack.
        <br>
        The next morning Pam and Martin's story is in all the newspapers.
        <br>
        There is Pam's photo of Alan Rook at the bus station. There is a picture of Martin and Pam, too.
        <br>
        In the newspaper, it says:
        <br>
        CAMERA GIRL GETS PHOTO OF ROOK POLICE IN ABERDEEN FIND BANK MONEY
        <br>
        The people at the bank are very happy. They give Pam and Martin a thousand pounds.
        <br>
        "My last photo's a good one after all," laughs Pam. "Now I can buy a very good new camera."
        <br>
        
        
        
        
        - THE END -

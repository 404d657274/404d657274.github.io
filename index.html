    <h1>The Hat</h1>
    <p>

        Bernardo lives in Rome. He likes hats. One day he is at a street market near the Colosseum. Suddenly, he stops.
        <br>
        "I like that hat!" he says.
        <br>
        Bernardo buys the hat.
        <br>
        "I can put it in a bag for you," the woman says.
        <br>
        "No, it's OK," Bernardo says. "I can wear it. Put my old hat in the bag, please."
        <br>
        Bernardo arrives home.
        <br>
        "Hello, Natalie," he says to his wife. "Do you like my new hat?"
        <br>
        Natalie looks at him. She thinks, "No!" But she says, "Why do you want another hat, Bernardo? You have twenty!"
        <br>
        "I like hats," Bernardo says. "And I like this hat."
        <br>
        Natalie sees some people in the street. "They're laughing at Bernardo's hat," she thinks. "What can I do with it?"
        <br>
        Two days later, Natalie takes the hat to a store. The store buys and sells clothes. The man in the store buys Bernardo's hat.
        <br>
        That afternoon, Bernardo looks for his hat.
        <br>
        "I can't find my hat, Natalie," he says.
        <br>
        He looks in every room of the house.
        <br>
        "I can buy you a new hat, Bernardo," Natalie says. She smiles. "Let's go to the store!"
        <br>
        Three days later, Anna buys the hat.
        <br>
        Anna is a student from the United States. She is in Rome on vacation.
        <br>
        "I love this hat!" she thinks. She smiles. "I can get some flowers for it."
        <br>
        A week later, Anna gets an airplane home.
        <br>
        She lives in California, near the ocean.
        <br>
        That weekend, she goes down to the harbor. She goes to a cafe for a drink.
        <br>
        Mitch is sitting in the cafe, too. He sees Anna's hat.
        <br>
        "Who's under that hat?" Mitch thinks.
        <br>
        Anna looks up and sees him.
        <br>
        "Hi," Mitch says. "I love your hat."
        <br>
        "Thank you," Anna says. She smiles.
        <br>
        "I'm Mitch," Mitch says.
        <br>
        "I'm Anna," Anna says. She thinks, "I like him. Maybe this is a lucky hat!"
        <br>
        Mitch moves to Anna's table. They talk about books and movies.
        <br>
        Anna tells Mitch about Rome.
        <br>
        "It's a good place for hats!" she says.
        <br>
        Mitch laughs. "A beautiful hat for a beautiful girl," he says.
        <br>
        "Thank you," she says.
        <br>
        "Come to the movies with me tomorrow, Anna," Mitch says.
        <br>
        "OK," Anna says. "Why not?"
        <br>
        Suddenly, the wind takes Anna's hat away.
        <br>
        "My hat!" Anna says.
        <br>
        The wind blows the hat out across the water.
        <br>
        "It's OK," Mitch says. "Can I buy you a new hat? Do you know a store near here?"
        <br>
        "Yes, I do," Anna says. "Thank you."
        <br>
        She smiles at Mitch.
        <br>
        It is early morning on a beach near the cafe.
        <br>
        Cal sleeps on the beach with Sunny, his dog. Cal has no money and no home. Every day, he plays his guitar on the street.
        <br>
        "Look, Sunny," he says. "A hat. Go and get it!"
        <br>
        Cal plays his guitar on the street that morning.
        <br>
        Many people stop and listen. They put money in the hat.
        <br>
        "Look at this money, Sunny!" Cal says. "This is a lucky hat! We can eat at the cafe today. And tomorrow!"
        <br>
        That night, a man comes to the beach. His name is Rod. He sees Cal and Sunny.
        <br>
        He sees the hat, too, and smiles.
        <br>
        "That's a good hat," he thinks.
        <br>
        He walks quietly across the beach. He takes the hat, then he walks away quickly.
        <br>
        In the morning, Cal says to Sunny, "Where's my lucky hat?"
        <br>
        Later that night, Rod goes into town.
        <br>
        He goes to a store. He has a gun.
        <br>
        "What do you want?" the woman in the store asks.
        <br>
        "Give me the money!" Rod says. "Quickly!"
        <br>
        "OK, OK," the woman says.
        <br>
        Rod takes the money and runs from the store.
        <br>
        The woman calls the police. "He's tall and thin," she says. "And he's wearing a green and yellow hat."
        <br>
        Later, two policemen see Rod on the street.
        <br>
        "He's wearing a green and yellow hat!" one policeman says.
        <br>
        "And he's tall and thin!" his friend says. "It's him!"
        <br>
        Suddenly, Rod sees them. He runs.
        <br>
        "It's this hat," he thinks. "It isn't a lucky hat!"
        <br>
        He throws away the hat.
        <br>
        The hat falls into a taxi. A young woman, Gina, is in the taxi. She laughs. "That's lucky!" she thinks. "I can wear this hat." The taxi arrives at Los Angeles airport.
        <br>
        "Are you going on vacation?" the taxi driver asks Gina.
        <br>
        "No, I'm going home to Italy," Gina answers.
        <br>
        A day later, Gina is in Rome.
        <br>
        "It's a beautiful city," she thinks. "And it's my city."
        <br>
        A man stops and looks at her hat. Gina sees him.
        <br>
        "Do you like hats?" Gina asks him.
        <br>
        "I love hats!" Bernardo says.
        
        
        <br>

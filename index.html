    <h1>Cinderella</h1>
    <p>	Cinderella is a pretty girl. She's got blue eyes and blonde, curly hair. She's always happy. She likes singing and playing with her pet cat and the mice in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>She lives in a big house with her two sisters. Her sisters are very ugly! They've got big noses and big, ugly feet!
    </p>
    <p>
        They don't like Cinderella, and she has to do all the work in the house.</p>
    <p>	They throw their clothes on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>	'Pick up our clothes!' they say.</p>
    <p>	They shout at Cinderella.    </p>
    <p>	'Clean the kitchen!'
    </p>
    <p>	'Wash the clothes!'</p>
    <p>	'Cook the dinner!'</p>

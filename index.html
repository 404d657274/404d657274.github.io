    <h1>The Adventures of
        Tom Sawyer </h1>
    <p>Chapter 1 - The Fence</p>
    <p>Tom Sawyer lived with his aunt because his mother and
        father were dead. Tom didn’t like going to school, and he
        didn’t like working. He liked playing and having
        adventures. One Friday, he didn’t go to school—he went
        to the river.</p>
    <p>Aunt Polly was angry. “You’re a bad boy!” she said.
        “Tomorrow you can’t play with your friends because you
        didn’t go to school today. Tomorrow you’re going to work
        for me. You can paint the fence.”</p>
    <p>Saturday morning, Tom was not happy, but he started to
        paint the fence. His friend Jim was in the street.</p>
    <p>Tom asked him, “Do you want to paint?”</p>
    <p>Jim said, “No, I can’t. I’m going to get water.”</p>
    <p>Then Ben came to Tom’s house. He watched Tom and
        said, “I’m going to swim today. You can’t swim because
        you’re working.”</p>
    <p>Tom said, “This isn’t work. I like painting.”</p>
    <p>“Can I paint, too?” Ben asked.</p>
    <p>“No, you can’t,” Tom answered. “Aunt Polly asked me
        because I’m a very good painter.”</p>
    <p>Ben said, “I’m a good painter, too. Please, can I paint? I
        have some fruit. Do you want it?”</p>
    <p>OK,” Tom said. “Give me the fruit. Then you can paint.” </p>
    <p>Ben started to paint the fence. Later, many boys came to
        Tom’s house. They watched Ben, and they wanted to
        paint, too.</p>
    <p>Tom said, “Give me some food and you can paint.” </p>

    <p>Tom stayed in the yard, and the boys painted. They
        painted the fence three times. It was beautiful and white. </p>
    <p>Tom went into the house. “Aunt Polly, can I play now?”
        he asked.</p>
    <p>Aunt Polly was surprised. “Did you paint the fence?”
        she asked.</p>
    <p>“Yes, I did,” Tom answered.
        Aunt Polly went to the yard and looked at the fence. She
        was very surprised and very happy. “It’s beautiful!” she
        said. “Yes, you can play now.” </p>
    <p>Tom walked to his friend Joe Harper’s house and played
        with his friends there. Then he walked home again. There
        was a new girl in one yard. She had yellow hair and blue
        eyes. She was beautiful. Tom wanted to talk to her, but she
        didn’t see him. She went into her house. Tom waited, but
        she didn’t come out again.</p>
    <p>Chapter 2 - In the Graveyard</p>
    <p>One morning before school, Tom’s friend Huck Finn
        waited for him in the street. Huck didn’t have a home, and
        he never went to school. People in the town didn’t like
        him. But Tom liked Huck.</p>
    <p>Huck said, “Let’s have an adventure.”</p>
    <p>“What can we do on our adventure?” Tom asked.</p>
    <p>“Let’s go to the graveyard at night—at twelve o’clock!”
        Huck answered.</p>
    <p>‘That’s a good adventure,” Tom said. “Let’s meet at
        eleven o’clock.”</p>
    <p>Then Tom went to school, but he was late. The teacher
        was angry. He asked, “Why are you late again?”</p>
    <p>“I’m late because I talked to Huck Finn,” Tom said.
        Then the teacher was very angry. “Sit with the girls,” he
        said to Tom.</p>
    <p>Tom sat near the beautiful new girl. He was happy. He
        looked at her.</p>
    <p>“What’s your name?” he asked.</p>
    <p>“Becky,” she answered.</p>
    <p>Tom smiled and said, “My name’s Tom.”</p>
    <p>The teacher was angry again. “Tom Sawyer, stop
        talking! Go to your place now,” he said. Tom went to his
        place. </p>
    <p>At twelve o’clock Tom and Becky didn’t go home. They
        stayed in the school yard and talked. Tom said, “I love
        you. Do you love me?”</p>
    <p>“Yes,” Becky answered.</p>
    <p>“Good,” Tom said. “Then you’re going to walk to
        school with me every day. Amy always walked with me.” </p>
    <p>“Amy!” Becky said angrily. “Do you love her?”</p>
    <p>“No,” Tom answered. “I love you now. Do you want to
        walk with me?” </p>
    <p>But Becky was angry with Tom. She walked away and
        didn’t answer. Tom was unhappy. He didn’t go to school
        in the afternoon.</p>
    <p>That night Tom went to bed at nine o’clock, but he
        didn’t sleep. At eleven o’clock he went out his bedroom
        window to the yard. Huck was there. They walked to the
        graveyard. They stopped behind some big trees and talked
        quietly. </p>
    <p>Suddenly, there was a noise. Three men came into the
        graveyard—the doctor, Muff Potter, and Injun Joe. Injun
        Joe and the doctor talked angrily. </p>
    <img src="2.png" alt="2.png">
    <p>Then Injun Joe killed the doctor with a knife. Tom and Huck watched.
        Then they went away quickly because they were afraid.
    </p>
    <p>They went to Tom’s yard. Huck said, “We can’t talk
        about this. Injun Joe can find us and kill us, too.” </p>
    <p>“That’s right,” Tom said. “We can’t talk about it.” </p>
    <p>Tom went in his bedroom window. He went to bed, but
        he didn’t sleep well. Tom and Huck didn’t talk to their
        friends or Aunt Polly about that night because they were
        afraid of Injun Joe.</p>
    <p>Later, some men went to Muff Potter and said, “You’re
        a bad man. You killed the doctor.”</p>
    <p>Chapter 3 - A Bad Day</p>
    <p>Becky was sick and didn’t go to school for many days.
        Tom was very sad. One morning, he said to Aunt Polly,
        “I’m very sick, and I want to stay home from school.”</p>
    <p>Aunt Polly said, “Here’s some medicine. Take this and
        you can get well quickly.”</p>
    <p>But Tom didn’t like the medicine. Peter, the cat, came
        into the room and looked at Tom. </p>
    <p>“Peter!” Tom said. ”Have some medicine!”</p>
    <p>Peter had some medicine. He didn’t like it! He went
        quickly out the open window and into the yard.</p>
    <p>Aunt Polly watched Peter. “Why did you do that, Tom?”
        she asked angrily. “You’re a very bad boy! Go to school
        now.”</p>
    <p>Tom arrived at school early and he waited for Becky at
        the school fence. She arrived early, too, but she didn’t look at Tom. She went into school. Tom walked away. He
        didn’t want to go to school now. He was very sad.</p>
    <img src="3.png" alt="3.png">
    <p>Joe Harper was near the school. He was sad, too,
        because his mother was angry with him. The two boys
        walked and talked.</p>
    <p>Tom said, “Let’s run away.”
        “Yes, let’s!” Joe said.</p>
    <p>The two boys went to the river. Huck Finn was there.
        Tom and Joe said, “We’re going to run away. Do you
        want to come with us?”</p>
    <p>“Yes,” Huck answered. “Let’s go across the river. We
        can have a good adventure there.”</p>
    <p>The boys went home because they wanted to get food
        for their adventure.</p>
    <p>Chapter 4 - Across the River</p>
    <p>Tom, Joe, and Huck went to the river. There was a small
        boat there. The boys went across the river in the small
        boat. They said, “This is a good place because we can play
        all day. There’s no school here.”</p>
    <p>They played and then went to sleep. </p>
    <p>In the morning, the boys were happy again. They said,
        “Let’s stay here for a long time.”</p>
    <p>In the afternoon, they played near the river again.
        Suddenly, there was a noise from a big boat on the river.
        The boys stopped playing and watched the boat.</p>
    <p>“Listen,” Tom said. “The men on the boat are talking
        about us.”</p>
    <img src="4.png" alt="4.png">
    <p>The boys listened quietly. A man said, “The boys are in
        the river. They’re dead.”</p>
    <p>Tom said, “Those men are looking for us in the river.
        We’re here, but they don’t know that.”</p>
    <p>That night, the boys were sad. Huck and Joe went to
        sleep, but Tom didn’t sleep. He went home in the small
        boat. He quietly went in his bedroom window. Then he
        went under his bed and stayed there.</p>
    <p>Aunt Polly and her friends came into his room. Aunt
        Polly said to her friends, “Tom was a good boy, and I
        loved him. Now he’s dead, and I’m very sad.”</p>
    <p>Tom wanted to say, “I’m not dead.” But he stayed quiet.
        Aunt Polly went to sleep. Tom went out the window
        very quietly and went back across the river.</p>
    <p>In the morning, Joe and Huck said, “We’re not happy
        here now. We want to go home.” <br>
        Tom said, “Let’s go home on Sunday. We can go to
        church. People are going to be very surprised!”</p>
    <p>Sunday morning, many children were at church. They
        talked about the three boys. They were sad because their
        friends were dead. Becky was sad, too.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, the three boys walked into the church. People
        were very surprised, but they were very happy, too.</p>
    <p>Chapter 5 - At School</p>
    <p>Monday morning, Tom went to school. The children
        wanted to hear about his adventure, and Tom liked talking about it. Becky wanted to talk to Tom, but he
        didn’t look at her.</p>
    <p>Then Tom talked to Amy. Becky watched him and she
        was angry. She said to her friends, “I’m going to have an
        adventure day. You can come on my adventure.” But she
        didn’t ask Tom. <br>
        Later in the morning, Tom talked to Amy again. Becky
        talked to her friend Alfred and looked at a picture-book
        with him. Tom watched them and he was angry with
        Becky.</p>
    <p>In the afternoon, Tom waited for Becky at the school
        fence. He said, “I’m sorry.” <br>
        But Becky didn’t listen to him. She walked into the
        school room. The teacher’s new book was on his table.
        This book wasn’t for children, but Becky wanted to look
        at it. She opened the book quietly and looked at the
        pictures. <br>
        Suddenly, Tom came into the room. Becky was
        surprised. She closed the book quickly, and it tore. Becky
        was angry with Tom and quickly went out of the room.
        Then the children and the teacher came into the room
        and went to their places. The teacher looked at his book.
        “Who did this? Who tore my book?” he asked angrily.
        The room was very quiet. The teacher started to ask
        every child, “Did you do this?” <br>
        They answered, “No, I didn’t.”</p>
    <p>Then he looked at Becky “Becky, did you do this?”</p>
    <img src="5.png" alt="">
    <p>Tom wanted to help her. Suddenly he said, “I did it. I
        tore your book.” <br>
        “Tom Sawyer, you’re a very bad boy. Stay here after
        school!” the teacher said angrily. <br>
        At five o’clock Tom started to walk home. Becky waited
        for him at the school fence. “You’re a very good friend,”
        she said. <br>
        Tom smiled at her and they walked home.</p>
    <p>Chapter 6 - The Trial </p>
    <p>Summer vacation started, and Becky went away with her
        family. Tom was unhappy. <br>
        Then Muff Potter’s trial started. Tom and Huck
        remembered the night in the graveyard. They were afraid
        of Injun Joe again. <br>
        “Did you talk about the night in the graveyard?”
        Tom asked Huck. <br>
        “No, I didn’t,” Huck answered. “Did you?” <br>
        “No,” Tom answered. “But. I’m sorry about Muff Potter.
        He’s always friendly to us. He didn’t kill the doctor. I
        want to help him.” <br>
        “Let’s take some food to him,” Huck said.
        The boys visited Muff Potter. “Here’s some food,” they
        said. <br>
        Muff Potter said, “Thank you. You’re good boys.”
        Tom and Huck went to the trial and listened for two
        days. Tom didn’t sleep well at night because he wanted to
        help Muff Potter. <br>
        On day three of the trial Tom talked.</p>
    <p>A man asked him, “Where were you on the night of
        June 17th?” <br>
        “I was in the graveyard,” Tom answered. <br>
        “Did you see any people there?” the man asked: <br>
        “Yes. Injun Joe, the doctor, and Muff Potter were there.
        They didn’t see me because I was behind some big trees.”
        “What did you see?” the man asked. <br>
        “Injun Joe and the doctor talked angrily,” Tom
        answered. “Then Injun Joe killed the doctor with his knife.
        Muff Potter didn’t do it.” <br>
        The people at the trial were surprised. Injun Joe quickly
        went out of the building. <br>
        Tom and Huck were very afraid. Tom said, “Now Injun
        Joe knows about us. He can kill us, too.” <br>
        Many people wanted to hear about the boys’ adventure
        in the graveyard. Tom liked talking about it. He was
        happy, too, because he helped Muff Potter. But he didn’t
        sleep well because he was afraid of Injun Joe.</p>
    <p>Chapter 7 - Injun Joe’s Treasure</p>
    <p>One Saturday afternoon, Tom wanted to have an adventure
        because he didn’t want to think about Injun Joe. He went
        to Huck and said, “I’m going to look for treasure. Do you
        want to come with me?”</p>
    <p>Huck always liked an adventure. “Oh, yes,” he said.
        “Where can we look?” </p>
    <p>“Let’s start looking in the old house near Mrs. Douglas’s
        house. Old houses are good places for treasure,” Tom
        answered. <br>
        The boys went to the old house. They wanted to look at
        every room. First they went into the kitchen, and then they
        went into the bedroom. <br>
        Suddenly, two men came into the kitchen—Injun Joe
        and his friend. The boys were afraid and stayed in the
        bedroom very quietly. <br>
        Injun Joe walked across the kitchen. “We can put our
        money here,” he said to his friend. <br>
        He started to dig under the floor with his knife.
        “What’s this?” Injun Joe said. “I’m going to get it out.”
        There was a big box under the floor. He opened it with
        his knife. There was a lot of money in the box. <br>
        “Look at that money!” his friend said. “Let’s go now.
        We can come back and get it tomorrow.” <br>
        “No,” Injun Joe said. “We’re going to take it with us
        now. We can take it to that place. You know—the place
        under the cross.” <br>
        Then the men went out of the house. Injun Joe talked
        quietly to his friend. The boys listened and were afraid.
        Tom said, “Did you hear that? He wants to kill us.”
        They went out of the house quietly and went home.
        The boys were afraid of Injun Joe, but they wanted to
        find his treasure. They watched his house every night, but
        they didn’t see Injun Joe or his treasure.</p>
    <img src="6.png" alt="">
    <p>Chapter 8 - Becky’s Adventure Day</p>
    <p>In August Becky’s family came back from their vacation.
        Tom was very happy and he didn’t think about Injun Joe’s
        treasure. <br>
        Becky’s adventure day was Saturday. Her mother said,
        “You can sleep at Susy Harper’s house after your
        adventure.’ <br>
        “Good,” Becky said. <br>
        Becky and her friends went on the river on a big boat.
        The boat went down the river and across it. Then it
        stopped. The children went out of the boat and played
        games near the river. In the afternoon one boy asked,
        “Who wants to go to the big cave?” <br>
        The children went to the cave. It was dark and cold
        there, but they played games. In the evening they went
        back to the boat and went home. <br>
        Sunday morning, Becky’s mother and Aunt Polly talked
        to Mrs. Harper at church. Becky’s mother asked, “Where’s
        my Becky? Did she sleep at your house?” <br>
        “No, she didn’t,” Mrs. Harper answered. “I didn’t see
        her.” <br>
        Aunt Polly said, “My Tom didn’t come home. Did he
        stay at your house?” <br>
        “No, he didn’t,” Mrs. Harper answered. <br>
        Then Aunt Polly and Becky’s mother asked the children,
        “Did Tom and Becky come home? Did you see them on
        the boat?” <br>
        The children answered, “No, we didn’t see them, but it
        was dark.” <br>
        Then a boy said, “Maybe they’re in the cave!”</p>
    <p>Two hundred men looked for Tom and Becky in the
        cave. They looked for three days, but they didn’t find
        them. People in the town were very sad. </p>
    <p>Chapter 9 - Huck’s Adventure </p>
    <p>Huck didn’t go on Becky’s adventure. He stayed home
        and watched Injun Joe’s house that night. At eleven
        o’clock Injun Joe and his friend came out and walked
        down the street. There was a box in his friend’s hands.
        Huck said quietly, “Maybe that’s the treasure box.” He
        went after the two men. <br>
        They walked to Mrs. Douglas’s house and stopped in her
        yard. Huck stayed behind some small trees. The men
        talked, and Huck listened to them. <br>
        Injun Joe was angry. “I want to kill her,” he said to his
        friend. “Mr. Douglas was bad to me. He’s dead now, but I
        remember.” <br>
        “’There are a lot of lights in the house. Maybe her
        friends are visiting,” Injun Joe’s friend said. “We can
        come back tomorrow.” <br>
        “No,” Injun Joe said. “Let’s wait now.” <br>
        Huck liked Mrs. Douglas because she was always good
        to him. He wanted to help her. He quietly walked away
        and then he started to run to Mr. Jones’s house.
        Mr. Jones opened the door. “What do you want?” he
        asked Huck. <br>
        “Injun Joe and his friend are in Mrs. Douglas’s yard,”
        Huck said. “They want to kill her. Can you go there and
        help Mrs. Douglas?”</p>
    <img src="7.png" alt="">
    <p>“Yes. My sons and I can go there,” Mr. Jones
        answered. “You can go home.” <br>
        In the morning, Huck went back to Mr. Jones’s house.
        “How’s Mrs. Douglas?” he asked.
        “She’s OK,” Mr. Jones answered. “The men went away
        because we arrived.” <br>
        “Good,” Huck said. But he was afraid of Injun Joe.
        “Please don’t say my name to Mrs. Douglas.” <br>
        Mr. Jones looked at him, and then he said, “You aren’t
        well. Go and sleep in my bedroom.” <br>
        Later, Mrs. Douglas visited Mr. Jones. <br>
        “You helped me yesterday night. Thank you,” she said.
        “You’re a good man.” <br>
        Mr. Jones said, “We didn’t know about the men in your
        yard. A boy was there and he wanted to help you. He came
        here, but I can’t say his name.” <br>
        Mr. Jones and Mrs. Douglas went to church. People
        there talked about Tom and Becky. Mr. Jones and his sons
        went to the cave with the men, but on Monday morning
        they went home. Huck was in bed and was very sick. The
        men went back to the cave, but Mrs. Douglas stayed with
        Huck.</p>
    <p>Chapter 10 - In the Cave</p>
    <p>Saturday, Tom and Becky walked and played in the cave. 
        Then they stopped near some water. <br>
        “What time is it?” Becky asked. <br>
        “I don’t know,” Tom said. “Let’s go back now” </p>
    <p>The two children walked and walked. But they didn’t 
        find the door to the cave. Becky was afraid. She wanted to 
        sit down and eat. “Maybe they’re looking for us now,” she 
        said. <br>
        “Here’s some food,” Tom said. “Eat this and wait here. 
        I’m going to look for the door.” 
        Tom walked and walked. But he didn’t find the cave 
        door. Suddenly, there was a man near him. Tom was 
        afraid, but he stayed quiet. He looked at the man. It was 
        Injun Joe! <br>
        Tom was very afraid and he made a noise. Injun Joe 
        went away quickly. Tom went back to Becky, but he 
        didn’t talk to her about Injun Joe. <br>
        They were in the cave for three days. Tuesday, Becky 
        didn’t want to walk. Again Tom said, “Stay here. I’m 
        going to look for the door.” <br>
        This time he went to a new place. There was light there. 
        He went to the light. It came from a small door in the 
        cave. <br>
        Tom went out of the cave. Then he went back to Becky. 
        “Come with me,” he said. “We can go out of the cave 
        now.” <br>
        Tom and Becky went out of the cave. They were very 
        happy. They went to the river and waited there. Some men 
        in a small boat came to them. <br>
        Tom said, “We want to go home. Can you help us?” <br>
        The men answered, “Yes. We can take you home.” <br>
        Tom and Becky went in the boat with the men. They 
        arrived home very late Tuesday night, and people in the 
        town were very happy. Tom talked all night about their 
        adventure in the cave.</p>

    <p>Chapter 11 - In the Cave Again</p>
    <p>Tom and Becky stayed home for many days. Then, two 
        weeks after their adventure, Tom visited Becky and talked 
        to her father. <br>
        Mr. Thatcher said, “You’re a very good boy, Tom. You 
        helped Becky in the cave. Thank you. People can’t go into 
        it now because it has a new big door.” <br>
        “But Injun Joe’s living in the cave!” Tom said. <br>
        Some men went down the river to the cave. Tom went 
        with them. They opened the new door. Injun Joe was 
        there, but he was dead. <br>
        Tom wanted to talk to Huck. Later in the week he went 
        to Mr. Jones’s house. The two boys talked about their 
        adventures. <br>
        “The money isn’t in Injun Joe’s house,” Tom said. “It’s 
        in the cave! I know, because Injun Joe was there. Let’s get 
        it!” <br>
        Huck was afraid. “But maybe we can’t find it.” <br>
        “I can find it again,” Tom said. “I know about a small 
        door at the back of the cave. Becky and I came out there. 
        We can go in that door, and I can find Injun Joe’s treasure.” 
        “OK,” Huck said. “Let’s go today.” <br>
        That afternoon the boys went in a small boat to the back 
        of the cave. Tom walked first, and Huck went after him. 
        They walked and walked. <br>
        Then Tom said, “This is the right place! Injun Joe was 
        here.” <br>
        The boys looked for a good place for treasure. <br>
        Suddenly, Tom said, “Look! There’s a cross! Injun Joe 
        said, ’under the cross.’ Let’s look there!” </p>
    <img src="9.png" alt="">
    <p>The boys went to the place with the cross. Tom said, 
        “I’m going to dig here with my knife ... Look! It’s the 
        treasure box! Let’s get it out now. The treasure’s ours!” 
        “This box is very heavy,” Huck said. “We can’t take it 
        with us.” <br>
        “I have some small bags,” Tom said. “We can put the 
        money in them and take it home.” <br>
        The boys went out of the cave with the money.</p>
    <p>Chapter 12 - At Mrs. Douglas’s House</p>
    <p>Tom said, “Let’s take the money to the old house near 
        Mrs. Douglas’s house. That’s a good place for it.” 
        They started to walk to the old house. Mr. Jones was in 
        Mrs. Douglas’s yard. He called to the boys. <br>
        “A lot of people are waiting for you. Come with me,” he 
        said. They went into Mrs. Douglas’s house. <br>
        “Hello, boys,” Mrs. Douglas said. “Come with me.” 
        Tom and Huck went with her to a bedroom. There were 
        new shirts and jeans on the bed. <br>
        “Wash your hands and faces and put on these shirts and 
        jeans,” Mrs. Douglas said. “Then come to the big room.” 
        The boys went to the room. A lot of people were there. 
        Mrs. Douglas said, “First I want to say ‘thank you’ to 
        Mr. Jones and his sons. They helped me. They’re very 
        good people.” <br>
        “Huck helped, too,” Mr. Jones said. <br>
         ‘Thank you, too, Huck,” Mrs. Douglas said. “You’re a 
        good boy, and I like you. I want to give you a home and 
        some money.”</p>
    <p>“But Huck has a lot of money!” Tom said. 
        He went to the bedroom and came back with the bags of 
        money. “We have this money from the cave There’s a lot 
        of money in them, and it’s ours now.” <br>
        There was $12,000 in the bags. The people were very 
        surprised. They asked about the boys’ adventure.</p>
    <p>Chapter 13 - Huck’s New Home </p>
    <p>Huck lived in the big house with Mrs. Douglas. He was a 
        new person. He washed every day, and he went to school 
        and church. But he wasn’t happy. He stayed there for three 
        weeks, and then he ran away. <br>
        Tom went to Huck. “Why did you run away?” <br>
        Huck answered, “Mrs. Douglas is a good woman. I like 
        her, but I can’t live with her. I don’t like washing every 
        day, and I don’t like going to school and church. I don’t 
        want to have a lot of money. But I want to be your friend. 
        OK?” <br>
        “No,” Tom said, “I can’t be your friend, because the 
        boys at school don’t want to play with you. We’re 
        thinking about a lot of new adventures. Please live with 
        Mrs. Douglas and come to school. Then the boys at school 
        can play with you.” <br>
        “I want to be your friend,” Huck said, “and I want to 
        have adventures with you and the boys at school. Maybe I 
        can live with Mrs. Douglas. I don’t know, but I’m going to 
        try it again for a month.” <br>
        “Good,” Tom said. “The boys are meeting later, at 
        twelve o’clock at night. You can come, too.” <br>
        “Good!” Huck said.
